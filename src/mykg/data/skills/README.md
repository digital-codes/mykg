# mykg skills

The `mykg/` directory ships with the mykg Python package and contains the **`/mykg` Claude Code skill** that drives the pipeline when the active profile is `agent-claude-code` (provider: `agent`).

This is the skill side of agent mode. The mykg pipeline writes LLM tasks to a session-local inbox folder; this skill watches the inbox, dispatches Agent-tool subagents to answer them, and writes answers back to an outbox. The pipeline subprocess never makes an HTTP API call — every LLM answer comes from a subagent the host Claude Code session spawned.

## Install

```bash
# Symlink the bundled skill into your Claude Code skills folder
ln -s "$(python -c 'import mykg, pathlib; print(pathlib.Path(mykg.__file__).parent / "data" / "skills" / "mykg")')" ~/.claude/skills/mykg

# Restart Claude Code (or re-open the project) so the skill loader picks it up
```

If you cloned the repo from source instead of `pip install`:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/src/mykg/data/skills/mykg" ~/.claude/skills/mykg
```

---

## Activate agent mode

The skill only does useful work when `mykg_config.yaml` selects the agent profile:

```bash
mykg init --profile agent-claude-code
```

This writes the profile shown below. The `agent:` block configures the inbox/outbox paths and poll interval; the `pipeline.pass2.max_workers` value sets how many subagents the skill dispatches per wave:

```yaml
profile: agent-claude-code

profiles:
  agent-claude-code:
    provider: agent
    agent:
      inbox_dir: agent_inbox        # relative to <session>/intermediate/
      outbox_dir: agent_outbox
      poll_interval_seconds: 2
    pipeline:
      pass2:
        max_workers: 8              # how many subagents the skill dispatches per wave
```

---

## Why pick agent mode

- **No API key needed.** Uses your existing Claude Pro/Max plan via the skill subagents — same as `claude-cli`, but without invoking the `claude -p` binary.
- **Inspectable LLM I/O.** Every prompt lands as `intermediate/agent_inbox/<id>.task.json` and every answer as `intermediate/agent_outbox/<id>.answer.json`. Replay or edit any step by hand.
- **Parallel by default.** The skill dispatches up to `pass2.max_workers` subagents per wave in a single message — not serial like `claude-cli`. Pass-2 chunks complete in parallel waves.

## Invoke from inside Claude Code

The skill exposes one slash command — `/mykg` — that accepts free-form intent. You describe what you want; the skill figures out which `mykg` CLI command to run, reads the live `--help` to validate flags, confirms expensive actions, and (for `extract-graph`) drains the LLM inbox in parallel waves.

Examples:

| You type | The skill runs |
| --- | --- |
| `/mykg extract ./docs` | `mykg extract-graph ./docs` |
| `/mykg ./docs` | `mykg extract-graph ./docs` (legacy positional alias) |
| `/mykg extract ./docs with human review` | `mykg extract-graph ./docs --review` |
| `/mykg append the new notes in ./docs` | `mykg extract-graph ./docs --append --session <latest>` |
| `/mykg resume the last session` | `mykg extract-graph --session <latest>` |
| `/mykg approve the schema` | `mykg approve-schema --session <latest>` |
| `/mykg make a walkthrough` | `mykg walkthrough --session <latest>` |
| `/mykg convert pdfs in ./inbox to ./md` | `mykg parse-docs --input ./inbox --output ./md` |

Any flag mykg accepts on the CLI works here too — the skill reads `--help` rather than maintaining its own list, so `--from-step orphan_connect`, `--workers 8`, `--obsidian-vault`, etc. all flow through.

`mykg init` and `mykg merge-graphs` are intentionally not wrapped: init is interactive (run from a shell once per machine), and merge-graphs has additional design questions and will be added in a follow-up.

---

## What the skill does on screen

1. Confirms `mykg_config.yaml` has `profile: agent-claude-code` — aborts with a clear message if not.
2. Launches `mykg extract-graph` in the background via `nohup` so it survives the skill turn.
3. Watches `<session>/intermediate/agent_inbox/` for `*.task.json` files.
4. Dispatches one Agent-tool subagent per unanswered task (parallel calls in one message, up to `pass2.max_workers` per wave).
5. Exits when the pipeline subprocess exits, when `output/knowledge_graph.ttl` appears, or after **20 watch waves** — at which point it tells you to re-invoke `/mykg --session <name> --continue`.

---

## Limitations and notes

- The skill is bounded at **20 waves per invocation** to avoid runaway Claude Code sessions. Long pipelines may need multiple `/mykg --session <name> --continue` invocations.
- The pipeline subprocess survives via `nohup`, so closing your Claude Code session does not kill it — the run continues in the background and you can re-attach by re-invoking the skill with `--continue`.
- For non-Claude-Code hosts (Copilot CLI, Cursor, custom scripts), nothing prevents you from writing your own drainer against the same `agent_inbox`/`agent_outbox` contract — the protocol is just JSON files on disk.
