# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

Implementation is complete. The pipeline is fully operational end-to-end.

Key design document:
- `docs/implementation-alternatives.md` — architecture decisions, data models, output formats, and design trade-offs

All design decisions (D1–D38) below are authoritative for the current implementation.

## What This System Does

A two-pass knowledge graph extractor that reads Markdown files and produces a property graph with an RDFS-compatible ontology layer.

- **Pass 1** — Schema induction: LLM reads batched MD files and proposes concept types (`concepts[]`) and relationship properties (`properties[]`) → produces `intermediate/schema.json`
- **Pass 2** — Instance extraction: LLM extracts individuals (`nodes[]`) and relationships (`edges[]`) against the schema → assembler writes edge metadata sidecar, deduplicates, and produces final outputs

---

## All Design Decisions

### D1 — Input Format
Markdown files only. Sources are heterogeneous: personal notes, technical documentation, and domain-specific structured content. The parser must handle YAML/TOML frontmatter, headings, lists, and code blocks as structural signals. Large files are chunked into overlapping windows before being sent to the LLM. Window size and overlap are set via `pipeline_config.yaml → pipeline.chunking` (defaults: 2000 tokens, 200 token overlap).

### D2 — Primary Use Cases
Three equal-priority consumers: search & retrieval, LLM reasoning/Q&A, and visualization. The graph must be rich enough to serve all three without specialization.

### D3 — LLM Backend: Provider-Agnostic
A pluggable adapter interface separates pipeline logic from LLM calls. Any backend (Anthropic/Claude, OpenAI, Ollama, OpenRouter, ClaudeCLI) can be swapped without changing extraction or assembly logic. Provider selection and all provider parameters (model, max_tokens, base_url, timeout) are set in `pipeline_config.yaml → llm.<provider>`; there are no hardcoded defaults in adapter code. Five adapter implementations exist: `anthropic_adapter.py`, `openai_adapter.py`, `ollama_adapter.py`, `openrouter_adapter.py`, and `claude_cli_adapter.py`. The `claude_cli` provider uses a `claude -p` subprocess — no API key required, billing via Claude Pro/Max plan; `max_workers` must be 1 (the CLI is serial by design).

### D4 — Pipeline Architecture: Option A (Sequential Two-Pass with Global Schema)
Pass 1 batches all files together to induce one global schema. Pass 2 extracts instances per file in parallel against that schema. Chosen over:
- Option B (per-file schemas + late merge) — too complex; merge logic is the hardest part
- Option C (iterative refinement) — fully sequential, highest LLM cost, non-deterministic stabilization
Upgrade path: design the schema induction module with the Option B merge interface in mind so migration is possible if corpora grow beyond a few hundred files.

Pass 1 batch dispatch is fully parallelized via `ThreadPoolExecutor` (worker count configurable via `pass1.max_workers`). `pass1.per_file_batching` — when true, chunks from different files are never mixed in one batch (Option B-style per-file isolation within Pass 1).

`pass2.stateful_chunks` — when true, prior-chunk node IDs are passed to the next chunk within a file, enabling stable IDs across chunk boundaries without a full file-level dedup pass between chunks.

### D5 — Ontology Model: Concept Taxonomy + Standard RDFS Properties
Two ideas combined:
1. **Concept taxonomy** — `is-a` hierarchy (`SoftwareEngineer` is-a `Person`; root classes have `"parent": null`)
2. **Standard RDFS properties** — relationship types are `rdf:Property` predicates with `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range`, not classes

This replaces the earlier "intermediate node pattern" (which modeled relationships as OWL classes `Employment`, `Dependency`, etc.). The new approach produces clean standard RDFS triples in `knowledge_graph.ttl`; edge metadata (confidence scores, role, start_date, etc.) is stored in a separate sidecar file `intermediate/edge_metadata.json`.

### D6 — Inheritance Strategy: Store Canonical, Flatten for Extraction
The schema stores only own attributes per concept type (compact, DRY). Before Pass 2, the pipeline flattens each concept's full attribute list by walking the inheritance chain. The LLM receives the flat list and never sees the word "inheritance". Chosen over:
- Inherit silently — LLM is inconsistent; misses inherited attributes unpredictably
- Store flat — duplicates attributes; hierarchy is lost; manual updates required when parent changes

### D7 — Schema Format: `concepts[]` + `properties[]`
The schema produced by Pass 1 has two top-level arrays:
- **`concepts[]`** — RDFS classes with `is-a` hierarchy (`type`, `parent`, `attributes`). Own attributes only; pipeline flattens at runtime before Pass 2.
- **`properties[]`** — RDFS object properties (`name`, `domain`, `range`, `attributes`). The `attributes` list defines the edge-level metadata fields (role, start_date, etc.) captured in the sidecar.

```json
{
  "concepts": [
    { "type": "Person",       "attributes": ["name", "email", "birth_date"],   "parent": null },
    { "type": "Organization", "attributes": ["name", "industry"],              "parent": null }
  ],
  "properties": [
    { "name": "works_at", "domain": "Person", "range": "Organization",
      "attributes": ["role", "start_date", "end_date"] }
  ]
}
```

No hardcoded root class. Root classes have `"parent": null`. No abstract `Relationship` class. No `relation_type` field. Relationship types are properties, not classes.

### D8 — Edge Metadata Sidecar (`intermediate/edge_metadata.json`)
Edge-level metadata (confidence scores, role, start_date, etc.) cannot live in pure RDFS triples. It is stored in a separate sidecar file keyed by edge ID. The sidecar is the source for `edges.jsonl` assembly. `knowledge_graph.ttl` contains no metadata — only pure RDFS triples.

Every edge in the sidecar carries a `"method"` field indicating how it was produced:
- `"llm_extraction"` — extracted by Pass 2 LLM and assembled by `deduplicate_edges`
- `"orphan_inferred"` — inferred by the orphan-connection pass (Stage 1 co-occurrence + Stage 2 LLM confirmation)

```json
{
  "edge-001": {
    "type": "works_at", "from": "person-alice", "to": "org-acme-corp",
    "confidence": 0.96,
    "method": "llm_extraction",
    "attributes": { "role": {"value": "engineer", "confidence": 0.91} },
    "source_files": ["team.md"]
  }
}
```

### D9 — Confidence Scores on Everything
Every extracted attribute value, node, and relationship instance carries a confidence score `0.0–1.0`. Format:
```json
{ "value": "engineer", "confidence": 0.91 }
```
Missing attributes are never dropped — they are `{ "value": null, "confidence": 0.0 }`. Downstream consumers filter by threshold.

### D10 — Deduplication Strategy
Nodes are grouped for deduplication by key = `hash(type + canonical_name)` where canonical_name is lowercased and whitespace-normalized. The actual stable ID format assigned to each node is defined in D19 (human-readable `<type-prefix>-<name-slug>`). When the same node appears across multiple files:
- Attribute values: keep the value with highest confidence; if both sources have confidence 1.0 and different string values, concatenate with `"; "` (lossless merge) — null values and non-string types always keep first-seen
- Node confidence: mean or max (configurable)
- Provenance: list of source files recorded on every merged node
- All merge decisions logged to `intermediate/merge_log.json`

Edges deduplicated by `hash(type + from_id + to_id)` — merge attributes keeping highest confidence (same confidence-1.0 concatenation rule as nodes), aggregate confidence (mean), union source_files.

### D11 — Output Format: Three Parallel Outputs (JSONL + RDF/OWL + NetworkX)
Three parallel output formats for different consumers:
- **JSONL** (`nodes.jsonl` + `edges.jsonl`) — for property graph consumers: Neo4j, NetworkX, visualizers, LLM RAG
- **Turtle RDF** (`knowledge_graph.ttl`) — for OWL consumers: Protégé, HermiT/Pellet reasoners, SPARQL endpoints
- **NetworkX formats** (`networkx_output/`) — GML, GraphML, GEXF, Pajek, JSON node-link, edge list, adjacency list; toggled via `pipeline_config.yaml → export.networkx_enabled`

All three are generated from the same in-memory data in `step_validate_graph` (Step 12). None is primary.

### D12 — `nodes.jsonl` — Concept Instances Only
`nodes.jsonl` contains all concept instances (Person, Organization, SoftwareEngineer, etc.) with full attributes and confidence scores. It does NOT contain relationship nodes — those no longer exist in the new design. Each record also carries an `aliases` field (see D29): a flat list of original surface-form strings for alternative names that were resolved to this canonical node during name normalization. The field is absent when the `normalize_names` step is disabled.

### D13 — `edges.jsonl` Derived from Sidecar
`edges.jsonl` is generated by the assembler from `intermediate/edge_metadata.json` — never edited directly. It contains flat `from/to/type/confidence/attributes` records for Neo4j importers and visualizers.

### D14 — `knowledge_graph.ttl` — RDFS + Standard Annotation Properties, Two Sections
The Turtle file has two sections: RDFS schema (TBox) and instance data (ABox). No edge metadata, no blank nodes, no reification, no RDF-star.
- **TBox**: class declarations (`rdfs:Class`, `rdfs:subClassOf`) + property declarations (`rdf:Property`, `rdfs:domain`, `rdfs:range`)
- **ABox**: node instance triples + `skos:altLabel` triples for aliases (when present) + one direct object property triple per edge (`:Alice ex:works_at :AcmeCorp`)

Confidence scores and edge attributes are absent from the Turtle file — they live in `edge_metadata.json` only. `skos:altLabel` (from the SKOS vocabulary) is used for alias annotation; it is a standard well-known predicate and does not require a TBox declaration. The ABox validator exempts the SKOS namespace from the `undeclared_predicate` check.

### D15 — RDFS Compatibility via Standard Properties + Sidecar
Standard RDF cannot hold properties on edges. The old approach (intermediate node pattern) is replaced with: relationship types become `rdf:Property` predicates in the schema, and edge metadata is stored in a JSON sidecar decoupled from the Turtle file. This keeps `knowledge_graph.ttl` clean and valid with any standard RDF toolchain.

### D16 — Intermediate JSON Files for All Pipeline Stages
All intermediate state is persisted as JSON between pipeline stages for debugging, resumability, and human review:

| File | Written | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `intermediate/base_schema_parsed.json` | Step 1 (only if `--base-schema` provided) | Locked classes + properties parsed from the user-supplied TTL file |
| `intermediate/thesaurus_parsed.json` | Step 1 (only if `--thesaurus` provided) | SKOS thesaurus metadata — source path, term count, relations used |
| `intermediate/schema.json` | After Pass 1 | Induced RDFS schema: `concepts[]` + `properties[]` — pipeline source of truth |
| `intermediate/schema.ttl` | After Pass 1 | TBox-only RDFS — validated by Step 3b; load in Protégé for review |
| `intermediate/schema_validation_errors.json` | After Step 3b (failure only) | rdflib syntax + semantic validation errors; absent if schema is valid |
| `intermediate/flattened_schema.json` | Before Pass 2 | Per-concept flattened attribute lists for LLM prompts |
| `intermediate/file_manifest.json` | After Step 1 | Map of filename → file content; enables Re-entry B after cold restart |
| `intermediate/pipeline_state.json` | After every step transition | Step status (pending/running/done/failed/waiting) and error details; written by orchestrator; used by `PipelineState.load` on re-entry |
| `intermediate/schema_validate.done` | After Step 3b (always) | Sentinel file; tells `_is_done` that schema validation completed so it is skipped on re-entry (the step has no data output) |
| `intermediate/raw_extractions_shards/` | During Pass 2 (per-file, written via `on_file_done`) | Per-file extraction shards — one `<slug>.json` per source file containing `{_fname, data}`; loaded on restart to skip already-extracted files (primary resumability mechanism) |
| `intermediate/chunk_index_shards/` | During Pass 2 (per-file, written via `on_file_done`) | Per-file chunk-node-index shards — one `<slug>.json` per source file; paired with `raw_extractions_shards/` |
| `intermediate/raw_extractions.json` | After Pass 2 completes (final merged write) | Raw `nodes[]` + `edges[]` per source file, merged from shards; overwritten from shards on every re-entry — do not edit directly (see D26 Re-entry B) |
| `intermediate/raw_extractions.done` | After Pass 2 completes | Sentinel file; tells `_is_done` that pass2 finished so it is skipped on re-entry |
| `intermediate/name_normalization.json` | After Step 6b (normalize_names) | LLM-produced alias→canonical name map + metadata; `mappings` key holds type-keyed map; empty sentinel written when normalization is disabled |
| `intermediate/edge_metadata.json` | After assembly | Edge attributes + confidence, keyed by edge ID — source for edges.jsonl |
| `intermediate/nodes.json` | After assembly | Deduplicated node list (JSON array); written by step_assemble, read by step_validate_graph on fresh-process re-entry (when `ctx.nodes` is None) |
| `intermediate/merge_log.json` | After assembly | Deduplication decisions audit trail |
| `output/knowledge_graph_validation.json` | After Step 12b (always) | TBox + ABox rdflib validation results — advisory, pipeline is complete at this point |
| `output/networkx_output/` | After Step 12c (when `networkx_enabled: true`) | NetworkX multi-format exports: GML, GraphML, GEXF, Pajek, JSON node-link, edge list, adjacency list |
| `intermediate/chunk_node_index.json` | After Pass 2 | Map of `{filename: {chunk_idx: [stable_ids]}}` — built by `pass2._process_file`; prerequisite for Stage 1 orphan scoring |
| `intermediate/orphan_candidates.json` | After `orphan_score` | Dict with two keys: `"groups"` (list of OrphanChunkGroup records — one per source chunk) and `"schema_gap_orphans"` (list of SchemaGapOrphan records for orphans with unresolvable provenance) |
| `intermediate/schema_history/` | During Pass 1 and schema-gap restarts | Numbered delta files tracking schema evolution; one file per schema write (`<seq>_<trigger>.json`) |
| `intermediate/failed_chunks.json` | After pass2 (when chunks skipped) | List of `{filename, chunk_idx, reason}` for every chunk that returned a blank/unparseable response after all retries; absent if no chunks were skipped |
| `intermediate/orphan_connections.json` | After `orphan_connect` | Dict of confirmed orphan edges `{edge_id: edge}` after Stage 2 LLM confirmation; merged into `edge_metadata.json` |
| `intermediate/orphan_log.json` | After `orphan_connect` | Audit trail of all orphan Stage 2 events. `orphan_edge_added` events carry: `id`, `type`, `from`, `to`, `confidence`, `rationale`, `llm_confidence`, `chunk_key`. `orphan_edge_rejected` events carry: `orphan_id`, `candidate_id`, `reason` only. |
| `intermediate/schema_gap_proposals.json` | After `orphan_connect` (schema feedback loop) | Raw LLM proposal for new schema properties to connect schema-gap orphans; written even when no properties are added (empty `new_properties` list); absent if schema-gap loop never runs |
| `intermediate/schema_approved.flag` | After `approve-schema` CLI command | Sentinel file; written by `mykg approve-schema`; its presence allows the pipeline to proceed past the human review gate when `--review` mode is active |
| `run.log` | During the run (session mode) | Log file auto-placed at session root; relative `--log-file` paths are redirected here; absent when `--log-file` is omitted outside session mode |
| `llm.log` | During the run (session mode) | One JSON line per LLM call — provider, model, token counts, latency, cache stats; written alongside `run.log` in the session root; absent when `--log-file` is omitted outside session mode |
| `intermediate/llm_calls/` | During the run (when `capture_prompts: true`) | Full prompt/response pairs — one `<n>_<slug>_input.md` + `<n>_<slug>_output.md` pair per LLM call; absent if `logging.capture_prompts` is false |
| `walkthrough.md` | After the run completes (session mode) | Human-readable markdown summary of the pipeline run — stats, schema overview, and per-step outcomes; written at session root by `step_walkthrough` |

### D17 — Human Review Gate Between Passes
After Pass 1, the schema is written to `intermediate/schema.json` (source of truth) and `intermediate/schema.ttl` (TBox-only RDFS view). Before the human review gate, `schema.ttl` is validated automatically using rdflib (syntax) and custom semantic checks (domain/range refer to declared classes, no conflicting ranges). If validation fails, the errors are sent back to the LLM with a correction prompt for one retry — the LLM returns a corrected schema, `schema.json` and `schema.ttl` are regenerated, and validation runs once more. The pipeline then always proceeds to the human review gate (Step 4) regardless of the second result. All validation outcomes (both attempts) are written to `intermediate/schema_validation_errors.json` for the reviewer. The user edits `schema.json` if needed; `schema.ttl` is regenerated from it before Pass 2 runs. The gate is optional but recommended.

### D18 — Interface: Python Library + CLI Wrapper
The Python library is primary. The CLI wraps the library. This enables embedding in larger pipelines programmatically while also supporting standalone command-line use.

### D19 — Assembler and Export Materialization Algorithm
The pipeline splits materialization across two steps: `assemble` (Steps 7–9) and `export` (Steps 10–12).

**`step_assemble` is responsible for:**
1. **Stable ID assignment** — format: `<type-prefix>-<name-slug>` where type-prefix = `node.type.lower()` (e.g. `"softwareengineer"`, `"organization"`) and name-slug = canonical_name with spaces replaced by hyphens (e.g. `softwareengineer-alice`, `organization-acme-corp`). Canonical_name = lowercased, whitespace-normalized `name` attribute value.
2. **Node deduplication** — group by ID across all files; merge attributes keeping highest-confidence value; if two string values both have confidence 1.0, concatenate with `"; "` rather than silently discarding; aggregate node confidence (mean or max, configurable); record provenance (source file list); union aliases
3. **Edge deduplication** — hash by `hash(type + from_id + to_id)`; merge attributes keeping highest confidence (same confidence-1.0 concatenation rule as nodes); aggregate edge confidence (mean); union source_files
4. **Sidecar write** — write all deduplicated edges to `intermediate/edge_metadata.json`; write deduplicated node list to `intermediate/nodes.json`

**`step_validate_graph` is responsible for:**
5. **nodes.jsonl export** — serialize each deduplicated node to one JSONL line
6. **edges.jsonl export** — emit one flat JSONL record per sidecar entry from `edge_metadata.json`
7. **knowledge_graph.ttl export** — Section 1: RDFS TBox (classes + properties with domain/range); Section 2: ABox (node instance triples + `skos:altLabel` alias triples + one direct object property triple per edge)
8. **NetworkX export** (Step 12c, when `networkx_enabled: true`) — builds a `DiGraph` from the same in-memory nodes/edges and writes all formats to `output/networkx_output/`; node/edge attributes are flattened to GML-safe scalars (`attr_<name>_value` / `attr_<name>_confidence`)

### D20 — Chunking Strategy for Pass 1
Large files are split into overlapping windows before Pass 1 LLM calls. Window size, overlap, and tiktoken encoding are configured via `pipeline_config.yaml → pipeline.chunking` (defaults: 2000 tokens, 200 token overlap, `cl100k_base`). Each batch of chunks produces a schema proposal. All proposals are merged by unioning concept types, deduplicating by exact name match, and resolving synonyms via `synonym_match` (exact + normalised string; SKOS thesaurus if provided — see D21, D28).

### D21 — Synonym Resolution in Pass 1 Schema Merge
After batching, the schema merge step unions all concept types and relationship types from all batch proposals, deduplicates by exact name match first, then resolves near-duplicates using `synonym_match(a, b)` (see D28). If no thesaurus is loaded, only exact and normalised string matching applies. If a SKOS thesaurus is provided: `skos:exactMatch` → collapse silently; `skos:closeMatch` → collapse with warning logged to `merge_log.json` including both names and thesaurus evidence. The result is written to `intermediate/schema.json` for optional human review before Pass 2.

### D22 — Edge Deduplication Key
Edges use a composite key: `hash(type + from_id + to_id)`. The `type` is the property name (e.g. `works_at`), `from_id` and `to_id` are stable node IDs. This ensures the same relationship extracted from multiple files is merged into one canonical edge record in the sidecar.

### D23 — Tool Targets per Output Format
- `nodes.jsonl` + `edges.jsonl` → Neo4j, Kuzu, Memgraph, NetworkX, visualizers (Gephi, D3, Sigma.js), LLM RAG context builders
- `knowledge_graph.ttl` → Protégé (schema authoring), HermiT/Pellet (OWL reasoning), SPARQL endpoints (Fuseki, GraphDB, Stardog)
- `networkx_output/knowledge_graph.graphml` → yEd, Gephi, Cytoscape (full attributes)
- `networkx_output/knowledge_graph.gexf` → Gephi native (richest metadata, dynamic graph support)
- `networkx_output/knowledge_graph.json` → D3.js, Sigma.js, web visualizers (JSON node-link format)
- `networkx_output/knowledge_graph.gml` → human-readable inspection, most graph tools
- `networkx_output/knowledge_graph.net` → Pajek network analysis (string attributes only)
- `networkx_output/edges_nx.txt` → simple text pipelines, quick inspection
- `networkx_output/adjacency.txt` → topology-only consumers

### D24 — Prompt Engineering
Full prompt templates are in `docs/implementation-alternatives.md` under "Prompt Engineering".

**Pass 1 system prompt must teach:**
- Output has two keys: `"concepts"` (RDFS classes) and `"properties"` (RDFS object properties)
- Each property entry has `name` (snake_case), `domain`, `range`, `attributes` (edge metadata fields)
- Do NOT output a `"relations"` array or a `"Relationship"` class

**Pass 2 system prompt must teach:**
- Output is `{ "nodes": [...], "edges": [...] }`
- `edges[]` entries: `type` = property name from schema, `from`/`to` = node IDs (not display names)
- Every attribute in `properties[].attributes` must appear in the edge output, null if unknown
- Every attribute in the flattened concept spec must appear in node output, null if unknown

**Assembler must validate after every LLM call:**
- Reject any edge whose `type` is not in the schema's `properties[]`
- Reject any edge whose `from`/`to` values are not valid node IDs from the same extraction
- On failure: log to `intermediate/raw_extractions.json`, warn, and optionally retry

### D25 — Step 12b: knowledge_graph.ttl Validation (Advisory)
After `knowledge_graph.ttl` is exported, it is validated by rdflib (syntax) and custom checks:
- **TBox checks** (same as Step 3b): all `rdfs:domain`/`rdfs:range` refer to declared classes, every non-null `rdfs:subClassOf` parent is a declared class
- **ABox checks**: every `rdf:type` object is a declared class, every predicate in ABox is a declared property, every object-property triple's object is a declared instance

The result is always written to `output/knowledge_graph_validation.json`. Errors are advisory only — the pipeline is already complete at this point. If ABox errors appear, use the Re-run Guide to diagnose whether the root cause is in raw extractions (Re-entry B) or assembler logic (Re-entry C).

### D26 — Re-run Guide: Four Re-entry Points
All intermediate files are preserved between runs. The pipeline can be re-entered at four points:

| Re-entry | Enter at | Trigger | Files reused |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — Schema changed** | Step 3b | Wrong concept, missing property, bad parent; Step 3b errors unresolved | None — schema change invalidates all extractions |
| **A (automated — schema-gap restart)** | `orphan_connect` | Schema-gap orphans detected by `orphan_connect`; `propose_schema_additions()` proposes new properties; `SchemaUpdatedError` raised; orchestrator invalidates `schema_validate` + `schema_flatten` + `pass2` + all downstream; restarts from `pass2` (not Step 3b); skips human review gate; capped at `orphan_pass.schema_max_restarts`. Shard directories (`raw_extractions_shards/`, `chunk_index_shards/`) are intentionally preserved — only the specific chunks named in `schema_hints.shared_chunks` are re-extracted (surgical re-extraction, see D37); all other file shards are reused. This avoids paying full re-extraction cost on every schema-gap restart. | `schema.json`, `orphan_candidates.json` |
| **B — Extraction errors** | Step 6 | LLM missed entities, wrong attributes, invented edge types; ABox errors in `knowledge_graph_validation.json` traceable to `raw_extractions.json` | `schema.json`, `flattened_schema.json` |
| **C — Assembly errors** | Step 7 | Bad dedup in `merge_log.json`; ABox errors traceable to assembler logic, not LLM output | `schema.json`, `flattened_schema.json`, `raw_extractions.json` |
| **C (normalization)** | assemble step | Wrong alias→canonical mappings in `name_normalization.json` | `schema.json`, `flattened_schema.json`, `raw_extractions.json`, `name_normalization.json` |
| **D — Orphan pass** | orphan_score | Wrong candidates in `orphan_candidates.json`; delete it and re-run from `--from-step orphan_score` | `schema.json`, `nodes.json`, `edge_metadata.json`, `chunk_node_index.json` |
| **D (LLM only)** | orphan_connect | Wrong confirmations in `orphan_connections.json`; delete it and re-run from `--from-step orphan_connect` | `orphan_candidates.json` + everything above |

Re-entry A (manual): edit `intermediate/schema.json` → regenerate `schema.ttl` → rerun from Step 3b onward.
Re-entry A (automated): triggered by `SchemaUpdatedError` from `orphan_connect` — restarts from `pass2` with no manual intervention required.
Re-entry B: `raw_extractions.json` is regenerated from shard files on every re-entry and must not be edited directly. To edit individual extractions, edit the per-file shard in `intermediate/raw_extractions_shards/<file_slug>.json`, then rerun from `--from-step pass2 --session <name>`. All shard files are deleted by `--from-step pass2` so that all files are re-extracted from scratch; per-file selective re-extraction is not supported.
Re-entry C: review `merge_log.json`, optionally edit `raw_extractions.json` → rerun from Step 7 onward.
Re-entry C (normalization): edit `intermediate/name_normalization.json` → rerun from `--from-step assemble` (does NOT re-run the LLM normalization call; assembler derives aliases from the edited map at assembly time).

### D27 — Optional Base Schema TTL (`--base-schema`)
The pipeline accepts an optional `--base-schema <file>.ttl` argument. The TTL must be a valid TBox-only RDFS file (same format as `intermediate/schema.ttl`). It is parsed in Step 1 into `intermediate/base_schema_parsed.json` and validated immediately — an invalid base schema halts the pipeline before any LLM calls.

**Lock semantics:** base schema classes and properties are locked throughout the pipeline.
- A locked class cannot be renamed, removed, or have its parent changed by LLM proposals
- A locked class can receive additional attributes (unioned from LLM proposals)
- A locked property cannot be renamed, removed, or have its domain/range changed
- A locked property can receive additional edge attributes (unioned from LLM proposals)
- LLM proposals that duplicate a locked name are merged into the locked entry (attributes unioned, structure from locked wins)
- Near-duplicate proposals (string similarity match) are collapsed into the locked entry with a warning in `merge_log.json`

**Pass 1 prompt injection:** every batch prompt includes a `EXISTING SCHEMA` block listing locked class and property names with an explicit instruction not to rename, remove, or duplicate them.

**Step 3b / Step 12b:** no special handling needed — locked classes enter the merge as declared classes and pass the same validation checks as any induced class.

### D28 — Optional External Thesaurus (`--thesaurus`)
The `--thesaurus <file>.skos.ttl` argument is optional. If omitted, `synonym_match` uses only exact and normalised string matching — no external lookup. `intermediate/thesaurus_parsed.json` is absent in that case.

**`synonym_match(a, b)` — the single resolution function used throughout Step 3:**
1. Exact string match → True
2. Normalised match (lowercase, whitespace/hyphen → underscore) → True
3. If SKOS thesaurus loaded: `skos:exactMatch` in either direction → True, collapse silently
4. If SKOS thesaurus loaded: `skos:closeMatch` in either direction → True, collapse with warning in `merge_log.json`
5. Otherwise → False

**Thesaurus vs base schema:** the thesaurus resolves synonyms among *induced* LLM proposals. The base schema (D27) locks the authoritative vocabulary. They compose: `synonym_match` is also applied between LLM proposals and locked names — if a proposal matches a locked entry, it is merged into the locked entry (lock wins).

**SKOS relations used:**
- `skos:exactMatch` — definite synonym, silent collapse
- `skos:closeMatch` — near-synonym, collapse with warning
- `skos:broader` / `skos:narrower` — advisory only (candidate parent/child hints, not enforced)

Thesaurus metadata written to `intermediate/thesaurus_parsed.json` only if `--thesaurus` was provided.

### D29 — Node Aliases: Source, Format, and Contract
After the `normalize_names` step (Step 6b), each node in `nodes.jsonl` and `intermediate/nodes.json` carries an `aliases` field containing the non-canonical surface forms that were resolved to that node.

**Source:** derived from `intermediate/name_normalization.json["mappings"]` at assembly time. `step_assemble` inverts the map (`alias→canonical` → `canonical→[aliases]`) and attaches aliases to nodes before `deduplicate_nodes` runs. Aliases are unioned across occurrences during deduplication.

**Format:** `aliases: list[str]` — flat list of original surface-form strings (not lowercased, not slugged). The canonical name itself is excluded. Lexicographically sorted for deterministic output. Field is absent (not `[]`) when `normalize_names` is disabled (`NORMALIZE_NAMES_ENABLED=false`).

**In `knowledge_graph.ttl`:** emitted as `skos:altLabel` triples in the ABox — one triple per alias per node. The `@prefix skos:` declaration is emitted only when at least one node has aliases.

**Edges do not have aliases.** Edges are structural triples `(type, from_id, to_id)` — not named entities. Relationship type synonyms are resolved at schema induction time by `synonym_match` in Pass 1, not at the instance level.

### D30 — Orphan-Connection Pass: Two-Stage Heuristic + LLM
An **orphan node** is a node present in `intermediate/nodes.json` whose stable ID appears as neither `from` nor `to` in any entry in `intermediate/edge_metadata.json` after `step_assemble` completes. Orphans are legitimate — they may represent singleton entities in the source corpus — but can degrade graph quality for traversal, visualization, and reasoning use cases.

The orphan-connection pass is two stages, registered as two separate pipeline steps (`orphan_score`, `orphan_connect`) to correctly scope the orchestrator retry/feedback loop:

**Stage 1 — `orphan_score` (`is_llm_step=False`):**
Uses `chunk_node_index.json` to map each orphan node to its source chunk(s). For normal orphans (present in the index), records all orphan IDs per `(filename, chunk_idx)` and all connected nodes from the same chunk. For blank-response orphans (absent from the index), cross-references `failed_chunks.json` and string-searches failed chunk texts from `file_manifest.json` to find the source chunk, then flags the node with `extraction_quality: "blank_response"`, `blank_chunk_file`, and `blank_chunk_idx`. Produces `OrphanChunkGroup` records — one per `(filename, chunk_idx)` — written to `orphan_candidates.json` as `{"groups": [...], "schema_gap_orphans": [...]}`. The schema type-pair filter from the previous design is removed — all orphans with a resolvable source chunk proceed to Stage 2 regardless of type compatibility.

**Stage 2 — `orphan_connect` (`is_llm_step=True`):**
For each `OrphanChunkGroup`, calls the LLM once to find all relationships between the group's orphan nodes and any connected node listed. The prompt includes the full chunk text (~1000 tokens), all orphan node IDs and names, a sample of connected graph nodes, and all schema properties. The LLM returns a JSON array of edges. Validates each edge (type must be in schema, from/to must be known node IDs); drops invalid edges. Updates `extraction_quality` on blank-response nodes: `blank_response → blank_recovered` if ≥1 edge found, `blank_response → blank_unresolved` if no edges found. Confirmed edges carry `"method": "orphan_inferred"`. Writes `intermediate/orphan_connections.json` and `intermediate/orphan_log.json`, then merges confirmed edges into `intermediate/edge_metadata.json`.

**Re-entry D:** `--from-step orphan_connect` reruns Stage 2 only; `--from-step orphan_score` reruns both stages (see D26).

Config keys for the orphan pass:
- `orphan_pass.excerpt_window` — character window around an orphan mention used as LLM context in Stage 2 (default 400)
- `orphan_pass.excerpt_context` — characters of surrounding context added around the window (default 150)
- `orphan_pass.blank_recovery_enabled` — whether blank-response orphan detection is active (default true)
- `orphan_pass.connected_sample_size` — max connected nodes included in the chunk recovery prompt (default 20)

### D31 — Two-Tier Correction Model
Corrections are organized into two tiers with an explicit escalation path:

**Tier 1 — KG-level corrections (within a single pipeline run):**
- `orphan_score` + `orphan_connect`: reconnect isolated nodes via co-occurrence heuristic + LLM confirmation
- `normalize_names` + `assemble`: resolve name variants before deduplication
- Per-step retry: every step gets one automatic retry before feedback is requested
- LLM feedback loop: for `is_llm_step=True` steps, the orchestrator calls `feedback.apply(step_name, error, ctx)` on a third attempt using a step-specific correction handler

**Tier 2 — Schema-level escalation (Re-entry A):**
Triggered when `orphan_connect` determines that schema-gap orphans cannot be connected with the current schema. The LLM proposes new RDFS properties; `propose_schema_additions()` validates that all proposed domain/range values are declared concepts before accepting them. When net-new properties are accepted, `step_orphan_connect` raises `SchemaUpdatedError`, which the orchestrator catches. The orchestrator then: (a) deletes outputs of all steps in `_SCHEMA_RESTART_INVALIDATE` (which includes `schema_flatten` so the new properties are flattened into LLM prompts), (b) resets in-memory state, and (c) restarts the step loop **iteratively** (not recursively) via an outer `while True` loop. The restart count is capped at `orphan_pass.schema_max_restarts` (default 1) to prevent infinite loops.

**Feedback handlers in `feedback.py`:**
- `pass1` / `schema_validate` → `_fix_schema`: correct `schema.json` and regenerate `schema.ttl`
- `schema_extend` → `_fix_schema_extend`: correct `schema.json` after a schema-gap proposal introduced invalid RDFS; reads both current schema and `schema_gap_proposals.json` for context
- `normalize_names` → `_fix_normalization`: correct `name_normalization.json`

The `schema_extend` handler is distinct from `schema_validate` because it has access to the proposal context (`schema_gap_proposals.json`) and can make a more targeted correction than a generic schema repair.

### D32 — Session-Based Run Isolation
Each `mykg extract-graph` run creates an isolated session folder under `sessions/` (configurable via `pipeline_config.yaml → pipeline.paths.sessions_dir`, default `sessions`). The session root contains three subdirectories: `input/` (copy of all input `.md` files), `intermediate/` (all pipeline state files), and `output/` (all final outputs). The log file is also placed here.

**Session directory layout:**
```
sessions/
  <YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS>/     ← UTC timestamp, auto-created per run
    input/                   ← recursive copy of all input Markdown files (subdirectory structure preserved)
    intermediate/            ← all intermediate pipeline files (D16)
    output/                  ← all final output files (D11)
    run.log                  ← log file (auto-placed; relative --log-file paths are redirected here)
```

**CLI behaviour:**
- `--session <name>` — selects an existing session; `intermediate/` and `output/` of that session become the working dirs; `input/` is refreshed
- `--session` is mutually exclusive with `--output-dir` / `--intermediate-dir`
- `approve-schema --session <name>` — finds `intermediate/` in the named session
- **Log file routing:** `setup()` is called after session resolution; if `--log-file` is omitted the log goes to `session_root/run.log`; relative paths are redirected to `session_root/<filename>`; absolute paths are used as-is
- **Bypass:** passing explicit `--output-dir` / `--intermediate-dir` skips all session logic; the old default paths from `pipeline_config.yaml` are used instead

**`_make_session_dirs(sessions_root)` helper** (`src/mykg/cli.py`): creates `<root>/<timestamp>/{input,intermediate,output}` and returns `(name, output_dir, intermediate_dir)`.

**`_copy_input_files(input_dir, session_root)`** (`src/mykg/cli.py`): copies all `.md` files from `input_dir` into `session_root/input/` using `rglob("*.md")`; subdirectory structure is preserved relative to `input_dir`.

### D32 — Hallucinated Anchor Node Removal in `_partial_recover`
When `_partial_recover` is invoked (degraded mode: retry failed), it drops edges that reference unknown or invalid node IDs. Without further action, nodes that were invented solely to anchor those edges survive — they have a valid schema type, so the type-whitelist filter passes them, but they carry no real content and become guaranteed orphans.

After computing `valid_edges`, `_partial_recover` performs a second pass: any node that is (a) new to this chunk — i.e. not present in `prior_nodes` — and (b) not referenced by any surviving edge is dropped as a hallucinated anchor. The `prior_nodes` exemption is essential: nodes extracted from earlier chunks are known-good entities; a later chunk may yet connect them and they must not be discarded.

This filter fires only in degraded mode, so the risk of false-positive drops (a real singleton entity with no edges in this chunk) is bounded. A genuine singleton would be in `prior_nodes` if it appeared in an earlier chunk, or will remain in `valid_nodes` of a later chunk that does connect it. The cost of dropping a genuine singleton here is that it does not appear in `prior_nodes` for the next chunk — the LLM may re-extract it, now with correct IDs.

### D33 — Blank-Response Orphan Flagging
When `_extract_chunk` returns `None` (blank or unparseable LLM response after all retries), pass2 records `{filename, chunk_idx, reason: "blank_response"}` to `intermediate/failed_chunks.json` via a thread-safe `FailedChunkLog`. In `orphan_score`, any orphan node whose stable ID is absent from `chunk_node_index.json` is cross-referenced against `failed_chunks.json`. If its source file had blank-response chunks and the node's display name appears in a failed chunk's text (string search via re-sliced `file_manifest.json`), the node is flagged with `extraction_quality: "blank_response"`, `blank_chunk_file`, and `blank_chunk_idx`. After recovery by `orphan_connect`, the flag updates to `blank_recovered` (≥1 edge found) or `blank_unresolved` (no edges found). Nodes with `blank_unresolved` are included in all final outputs — they are epistemically distinct from genuine singletons (`extraction_quality` absent = clean extraction, no field written).

### D34 — Unified Chunk-Level Orphan Pass
The orphan pass batches by source chunk rather than by candidate pair. Stage 1 (`orphan_score`) maps each orphan to its source chunk(s) and produces `OrphanChunkGroup` records — one per `(filename, chunk_idx)` — containing all orphan IDs and connected node IDs from that chunk. Stage 2 (`orphan_connect`) makes one LLM call per group with the full ~1000-token chunk text, not a 400-char excerpt per pair. This reduces total LLM calls (one per chunk vs one per candidate pair — 91 calls in a test run dropped to ~10) and gives the LLM full context to find relationships. The schema type-pair filter from the v1 design is removed — it was causing false schema-gap orphans by eliminating candidates before the LLM had a chance to evaluate them from the raw text.

### D35 — Pass 1: Three-Stage Schema Induction
Pass 1 runs four sequential stages after initial batching:

1. **Parallel batch induction** — `ThreadPoolExecutor` dispatches one LLM call per batch (max_workers=`pass1.max_workers`). Each batch returns a `{concepts, properties}` proposal.
2. **Schema merge** — `merge_proposals()` unions all batch results, deduplicating by exact name and `synonym_match`. Writes `intermediate/schema.json`. Config: `pass1.per_file_batching` (bool, default false — when true, chunks from different files are never mixed in the same batch).
3. **Schema harmonization** — `harmonize_schema()` makes one LLM call to collapse semantic near-duplicates (e.g. "MilitaryUnit" vs "ArmyUnit") that exact-match missed. Sees both the merged schema and all raw batch proposals. Uses the adapter's default max_tokens and timeout from the llm: profile block. Returns the original if the response is unparseable.
4. **Schema quality review** — `review_schema_quality()` makes one LLM call to remove overly narrow concept types (e.g. named-entity concepts like "FourthAirForce" → remove, extract as MilitaryUnit instance), fix singleton types, collapse subclasses that add no own attributes, deepen/flatten hierarchy as needed, and ensure every concept has at least a "name" attribute. Same config knobs as harmonization (uses default `max_tokens` from the active profile).

All four stages write delta records to `intermediate/schema_history/` via `schema_history.write_schema()` (see D36).

### D36 — Schema History Module
Every schema write is recorded in `intermediate/schema_history/` as a numbered delta file `<seq>_<trigger>.json` containing the trigger label, timestamp, lists of concepts/properties added and removed, and running totals. Trigger labels:
- `pass1_merge` — initial schema produced by Pass 1 merge step
- `schema_harmonize` — after the harmonization LLM call
- `schema_quality` — after the quality review LLM call
- `schema_validate` — LLM correction after RDFS validation failure
- `schema_gap` — new properties added by orphan schema-gap loop
- `schema_gap_correct` — LLM correction after schema-gap proposal introduced invalid RDFS

This directory is written by `src/mykg/schema_history.py` and can be used to reconstruct the schema evolution across a run.

### D37 — Surgical Re-extraction on Schema-Gap Restart
When `SchemaUpdatedError` fires (Re-entry A automated), the orchestrator does NOT delete the shard directories. Instead:
- `ctx.schema_hints` is populated with per-orphan data: `orphan_id`, `orphan_type`, `orphan_name`, `new_properties`, `shared_chunks` (list of `"filename::chunk_idx"` strings)
- Pass 2 receives `reextract_chunks` dict and `prior_extractions` from existing shards
- Only the specific chunks in `schema_hints.shared_chunks` are re-extracted; all other file shards are reused
- New edges from re-extracted chunks are merged back into existing shards via `_on_file_done_surgical`

This is more efficient than a full pass2 re-run: only the chunks where orphans appeared are re-processed, paying O(affected_chunks) LLM cost rather than O(files × restarts).

### D38 — Cross-Session Merge (`mykg merge-graphs`)
The `mykg merge-graphs <session-A> <session-B>` command merges two independently-produced pipeline sessions into a new unified session. Both source sessions are read-only; all output lands in a fresh timestamped session folder.

**Schema merge chain:** Both schemas are wrapped as proposals and passed to `merge_proposals([schema_a, schema_b], ...)`, then `harmonize_schema()`, then `review_schema_quality()` — the same chain used in Pass 1 schema induction (D35). Every schema write is recorded in `schema_history/` with trigger `"session_merge"`.

**File namespacing:** All file-keyed structures (raw_extractions keys, shard filenames, node/edge `source_files` lists) are namespaced as `<session_alias>/<original_filename>` before any merge. This makes same-filename documents from different sessions structurally distinct. Node deduplication then works normally — same type+name → same stable ID regardless of which session produced it.

**`source_map.json`:** Written at the start of every merge to `intermediate/source_map.json`. Maps every namespaced file key to its full provenance: original session name, original path, SHA256, and role (`input_a` / `input_b`). The `_meta` block records the `prep_mode` of each source session. See `docs/session-merge.md` for the full format.

**`merge_manifest.json`:** Written at the end of every merge to `intermediate/merge_manifest.json`. Fields: `session_a`, `session_b`, `merged_at` (ISO timestamp), `schema_synonym_log`, `reextraction_strategy`, `schema_delta_session_a`, `schema_delta_session_b`.

**Re-extraction strategy (`merge_graphs.reextraction_strategy`):** Controls what happens when the merged schema has new properties absent from a source session's original schema. Three mutually exclusive values in `pipeline_config.yaml`:
- `"none"` — accept gaps; no extra LLM cost
- `"surgical"` — targeted chunk re-extraction using `chunk_node_index`. For each new property, identifies chunks containing nodes of the property's domain or range type. Only those chunks are re-extracted; all other shards are reused. New nodes produced by the LLM are dropped — only new edges and enriched attribute values survive. Falls back to full chunk enumeration if `chunk_node_index` is unavailable. Bounded by `merge_graphs.surgical_top_k_chunks_per_property` (0 = disabled, zero candidates produced; >0 = top-K chunks per new property, ranked by domain/range node co-occurrence count).
- `"full"` — re-extract all files from both sessions

**`prep_mode` compatibility:** All three pass2 prep modes (`per_file`, `concat`, `batch_chunks`) produce identical shard formats. Sessions run with different prep_modes can be merged with no special handling.

**Extract pipeline steps (STEPS — `mykg extract-graph`):**

| # | Step | LLM | Key outputs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ingest` | — | `file_manifest.json` |
| 2 | `pass1` | ✓ (3 calls) | `schema.json`, `schema.ttl`, `schema_history/` |
| 3 | `schema_validate` | — | `schema_validate.done` |
| 4 | `human_review` | — | `schema_approved.flag` *(gate, opt-in via `--review`)* |
| 5 | `schema_flatten` | — | `flattened_schema.json` |
| 6 | `pass2` | ✓ | `raw_extractions.json`, `chunk_node_index.json`, `failed_chunks.json` |
| 7 | `normalize_names` | ✓ | `name_normalization.json` |
| 8 | `assemble` | — | `edge_metadata.json`, `nodes.json`, `merge_log.json` |
| 9 | `orphan_score` | — | `orphan_candidates.json` |
| 10 | `orphan_connect` | ✓ | `orphan_connections.json`, `orphan_log.json`, `schema_gap_proposals.json` |
| 11 | `validate_graph` | — | `nodes.jsonl`, `edges.jsonl`, `knowledge_graph.ttl`, `knowledge_graph_validation.json` |

**Step-based pipeline (MERGE_STEPS — `mykg merge-graphs`):**

The merge pipeline is implemented as a 12-step `MERGE_STEPS` registry in `merge_pipeline.py`, orchestrated by `merge_run.py`. Steps run via the same `PipelineState` / `_is_done` / retry pattern as the extract pipeline.

| # | Step | LLM | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `merge_setup` | — | Loads both SessionData objects, namespaces and copies shards, writes `source_map.json` |
| 2 | `merge_schema` | ✓ (3 calls) | `merge_proposals()` + `harmonize_schema()` + `review_schema_quality()` → `schema.json`, `schema.ttl`, `schema_history/` |
| 3 | `schema_validate` | — | Reused from extract pipeline |
| 4 | `human_review` | — | Reused; gate controlled by `merge_graphs.human_review` config flag |
| 5 | `schema_flatten` | — | Reused from extract pipeline |
| 6 | `merge_reextract` | ✓ | Re-extracts affected chunks per strategy (`none`/`surgical`/`full`) |
| 7 | `merge_raw` | — | Namespaces + merges raw extractions from both sessions |
| 8 | `assemble` | — | Reused from extract pipeline |
| 9 | `orphan_score` | — | Maps orphan nodes to source chunks → `orphan_candidates.json` |
| 10 | `orphan_connect` | ✓ | LLM confirms edges for orphan groups → `orphan_connections.json` |
| 11 | `validate_graph` | — | Reused from extract pipeline |
| 12 | `merge_manifest` | — | Writes `merge_manifest.json` |

**MergeContext fields:**

`MergeContext(PipelineContext)` adds these merge-specific fields:
- `session_a_name: str` — name of source session A
- `session_b_name: str` — name of source session B
- `sessions_root: Path` — parent directory of all sessions
- `session_a: SessionData | None` — populated by `merge_setup`
- `session_b: SessionData | None` — populated by `merge_setup`
- `source_map: dict | None` — populated by `merge_setup`
- `synonym_log: list` — synonym collapse events from `merge_schema`
- `schema_delta_a: list` — new property names absent from session A's original schema
- `schema_delta_b: list` — new property names absent from session B's original schema

**Surgical re-extraction invariant:**

In surgical mode, `reextract_for_merge()` merges the full output of `run_pass2` back into the session shards — both new edges (using the merged property types) and any net-new nodes the LLM extracted under the richer schema survive.

**`walkthrough.md` for merge sessions:**

The walkthrough includes a Merge Provenance section automatically when `source_map.json` is present:
- **Before & After** — node/edge/concept/property counts per source session and merged
- **Node Provenance** — counts for A-only, B-only, deduplicated, net-new nodes
- **Edge Provenance** — A-to-A, B-to-B, cross-session, and edges using new merged property types

---

## Key Invariants

1. The LLM returns `nodes[]` + `edges[]`. Edges are direct (from/to/type/attributes), not wrapped in nodes.
2. `knowledge_graph.ttl` contains RDFS structural triples and standard SKOS annotation properties (`skos:altLabel` for aliases) — no edge metadata, no blank nodes, no reification, no RDF-star.
3. Edge metadata lives exclusively in `intermediate/edge_metadata.json`.
4. `edges.jsonl` is always regenerated from the sidecar — never edited directly.
5. The abstract `Relationship` class does not exist — no relationship classes in `concepts[]`.
6. Missing attributes are never dropped — always `{ "value": null, "confidence": 0.0 }`.
7. No hardcoded parameters inside code — all values (timeouts, token limits, model names, namespace URIs, overlap sizes, confidence defaults, etc.) are loaded at startup from `pipeline_config.yaml` by `src/mykg/config.py`. The YAML file is the single source of truth; `config.py` exposes named constants; adapters and pipeline steps read from those constants, never from inline literals.
8. All data models use Pydantic (`BaseModel`) — not Python `dataclasses`. Pydantic is used for all structured data passed between pipeline stages: schema objects, nodes, edges, extraction results, and intermediate representations. This gives free JSON serialization/deserialization, field validation, and type coercion at pipeline boundaries.
9. Each run is fully isolated — inputs, intermediate state, outputs, and logs are co-located and self-contained. A run can always be resumed from its own snapshot without depending on external state.
10. Long-running extraction is resumable at the finest meaningful granularity. Work already completed is never repeated on restart; only the remaining work is resubmitted.
11. Log output is bounded and durable. Logs are scoped to their run, rotate automatically when large, and are never silently discarded.
12. All data-processing stages that operate over independent items (files, chunks, candidates) must be parallelised using `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Serial loops over collections are a bug. Worker count is always configurable via `pipeline_config.yaml` — never hardcoded. This applies to ingest, Pass 1 batch dispatch, Pass 2 file extraction, orphan scoring, and any future bulk step.
13. The pipeline must respect the active LLM provider's context window and rate limits. `window_tokens + max_tokens` must never exceed the model's context window. Worker counts (`pass2.max_workers`, `orphan_pass.max_workers`) must be set conservatively enough to avoid 429 rate-limit errors from the provider. When a 429 is received, it is a misconfiguration signal — reduce `max_workers` in `pipeline_config.yaml`, not a transient error to silently retry.
14. All pipeline outputs must be validated before writing to disk, and all output formats must be kept in sync. In `step_validate_graph`, edges are filtered to `valid_edge_metadata` — only edges whose `type` is declared in `schema["properties"]` — before any output file is written. The TTL is then sanitized (`sanitize_abox_ttl`) and validated (`validate_knowledge_graph_ttl`) before `knowledge_graph.ttl`, `edges.jsonl`, and NetworkX files are written. `intermediate/edge_metadata.json` remains the unfiltered source of truth; the filter is applied only at export time. This ensures all output formats (TTL, JSONL, NetworkX) are always valid and consistent with each other.
15. In surgical re-extraction mode, the full `run_pass2` output is merged back into session shards without post-filtering. Both net-new nodes and new edges produced under the richer merged schema survive and flow into the deduplication step as normal.
16. Every new process or strategy must be evaluated for runtime complexity before implementation. Explicitly reason about how it performs when the input is large — thousands of files, tens of thousands of nodes, hundreds of schema-gap restarts, or deep iteration loops. Prefer designs whose cost grows sub-linearly with corpus size (e.g. chunk-targeted over file-targeted, surgical over full re-extraction). Any strategy whose cost is O(files × restarts) or worse must be explicitly justified, bounded by a configurable cap, and documented with its worst-case scaling behaviour.

Additional config keys governed by Invariant 7 (all values from `pipeline_config.yaml`):
- `error_gate.enabled` — bool; circuit breaker that pauses all LLM workers when consecutive API errors exceed threshold
- `error_gate.threshold` — int; number of consecutive errors before the gate trips
- `logging.max_bytes` — log rotation: max bytes per log file before rotation (RotatingFileHandler)
- `logging.backup_count` — log rotation: number of rotated files to keep
- `logging.capture_prompts` — bool; when true, full LLM prompts are written to `intermediate/llm_calls/` at DEBUG level
- `normalize_names.max_names_per_type` — cap on names per type sent to normalization LLM
- `ingest.max_workers` — parallel workers for file reading/hashing/chunking
